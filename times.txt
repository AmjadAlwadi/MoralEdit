Method, Editing time for 1 norm 1 beam, Full time for 1 norm 1 beam     

With batch generation on, we get:

WISE, 44.6 min, ?
ROME, 7.5 min, 8.1 min
R-ROME, 4.3 min, 5 min
GRACE, 4.3 min, 4.7 min
MELO, 2.6 min, 3.6 min
LORA, 1,2 min, 1.6 min
FT-L, 1 min, 1.5 min
FT-M, 0.7 min, 1.1 min
IKE, 0 min, 28s, 69.12s, 92s

MEND, 19s, 1 beam: 43s, 5 beams: 115s, 10 beams: 155s

only beams <= 3 it's possible to get in reasonable time

10 for 1 seq_edit
2 for 2
2 for 3
2 for 4
2 for 5
2 for 10

this 2 times because 2 models

would like to evaluate model with opencompass tool for example but the overhead will be too large
it takes according to my estimations about 1h to evaluate for 1 model for one metric/dataset
so in terms of saving the post-edit-model into disk and time consumption this needs to much resources


With batch generation off, we get:

improved times with sequential generation instead of batching
